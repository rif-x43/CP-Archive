# CP-Archive

> A comprehensive archive of my competitive programming journey - solutions, contests, and continuous learning.

## üìö Repository Structure

This repository is a centralized hub for all my competitive programming solutions and contest participation. It's organized into two main sections:

## Platforms
- Codeforces
  - 800 Ratings
  - 900 Ratings
- LeetCode
  - Easy
  - Medium
  - Hard
- CodeChef
- AtCoder
- HackerRank 

Solutions to problems from various online competitive programming platforms.

## Contests

Archive of all contest participations, including real-time and virtual contests for practice.

### Contest Types

#### Real Contests
Actual contest participations with timestamps and rankings.
- Real Contests
  - IAPC Preliminary : AUST CSE Carnival <6.0>
  - IAPC : AUST CSE Carnival <6.0>
  - Preliminary Programming Contest :  8th DRMC International Tech Carnival 2025


#### Virtual Contests
Practice contests are done virtually to improve skills and test strategies.
- Virtual Contests
  - Codeforces Div 3 (Round)


### Contest Directory Structure

Each contest directory contains:
- **Solution files**: Code submissions for each problem
- **README.md**: Contest details, problems attempted, and key learnings
- **results.md** (for real contests): Final standings, rating changes, time taken
- **performance.md** (for virtual contests): Self-assessment and areas for improvement

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution Template

Each problem solution follows this structure:

```cpp
/*
 * Problem: [Problem Name]
 * Platform: [Codeforces/LeetCode/etc.]
 * URL: [Direct link to problem]
 * Difficulty: [Easy/Medium/Hard]
 * Topics: [Tags/Topics]
 * Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
 */

// Approach/Algorithm explanation
/*
 * Brief description of the approach
 * Time Complexity: O(?)
 * Space Complexity: O(?)
 */

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Solution code here

int main() {
    // Driver code
    return 0;
}
```
